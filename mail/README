Synopsis:

Manage email sending, retrieval and storage

 * SendMailQueue - sending mail is a typically expensive operation, so it makes
 sense to queue outgoing messages and send in batch operations. Clients may also
 want the opportunity to cancel outgoing messages prior to sending.
 
 * POP message retrieval is typically performed periodically by copying messages
 from a remote store to a local one (and optionally deleting from the remote store).
 
 * IMAP clients typically support caching of message headers and/or body.
 
 * Some components may monitor incoming and/or outgoing messages for relevant content.
 For example, a calendar component may check for attached iCalendar objects, an
 address book component may monitor vCard attachments, or a document repository
 may monitor for PDF, MS Office, etc. attachments. Additionally, mail filters may
 be applied as messages are received to assist with categorisation and organisation.
 
 * Message Rules - periodic execution of message rules can help with message organisation.
 Example rules include archival of old messages, deletion of expired messages, etc.
